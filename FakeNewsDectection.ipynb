Hornberger   As US officials continue to accuse Russia of meddling with the US presidential election, an accusation that they have provided no evidence whatsoever to support, let\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s review some of the US government\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s history of meddling with elections in others countries.1. In 1951, the democratically elected parliament of Iran elected a man named Mohammad Mossadegh to be Iran\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s prime minister. Mossadegh angered British Empire officials by nationalizing British oil interests in the country.British officials then turned to the CIA for assistance. In 1953, the CIA secretly fomented a violent coup in Iran, which succeeded in ousting Mossadegh from power and making the Shah of Iran the supreme unelected dictator of the country.To fortify the Shah\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s dictatorial hold on power, the CIA helped organize and train the his domestic police force, the Savak, which was essentially a combination of the CIA, the NSA, and the military. Part of the CIA\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s training involved teaching Savak agents the art of torture.For the next 26 years, the Iranian people suffered under one of the most brutal and tyrannical dictatorships in the world, one that US officials fully supported and called an ally and friend of the United States.In 1979, Iranians successfully revolted against the Shah\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s regime and ousted him from power. One result was not a restoration of the democratic system that had elected Mossadegh but rather another brutal dictatorship, this time a religious one. Another result is the bad relations between the Iran and US governments that continues to exist today.2. In 1951, the Guatemalan people democratically elected a man named Jacobo Arbenz to be their president. Arbenz, however, was not satisfactory to US officials, especially the national-security branch of the government, specifically the Pentagon and the CIA. The reason that US officials opposed Arbenz was that he was a socialist, and US officials considered a socialist president of Guatemala to be a threat to \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cnational security\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d here in the United States.In 1954 \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 one year after the coup in Iran, the CIA fomented a violent military coup that succeeded in removing Arbenz from power and replacing him with one of the most brutal unelected military dictators in Latin American history, a man named Carlos Castillo Armas. The CIA had a kill list prepared for the coup, which Arbenz was able to escape by fleeing the country before Castillo was able to get him. The CIA\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s destruction of Guatemala\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s democratic system threw the nation into a 30-year civil war that ended up killing millions of Guatemalan people, especially many of the poor.3. In 1960 a man named Patrice Lamumba was elected Congo\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s first prime minister after independence from Belgium. Lamumba spoke out against Western imperialism and refused to take sides in the Cold War, which caused the CIA to conclude that he was a threat to \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cnational security.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d The CIA orchestrated the assassination of Lamumba, which ended up taking place on January 17, 1961, just three days before President Kennedy, who liked Lamumba and who would have ordered the CIA to stand down, was to be sworn into office.4. In 1970 a man named Salvador Allende received a plurality of votes in the presidential election in Chile. Pursuant to the Chilean constitution, the election was thrown into the national congress. President Richard Nixon, his national-security team, the Pentagon, and the CIA concluded that because Allende believed in communism and socialism, he posed a grave threat to \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cnational security\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d here in the United States. The CIA attempted to bribe members of the congress to vote against Allende. It also orchestrated the kidnapping of the head of Chile\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s armed forces, Gen Rene Schneider, who opposed a US military coup in his country, especially since a coup would violate the country\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s constitution. The kidnapping attempt on Schneider left him dead.The CIA then fomented a coup that took place on 9/11 1973 that violently ousted Allende from power and left him dead. Replacing him was army Gen. Augusto Pinochet, one of the most brutal unelected military dictators in history. By the time Pinochet\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s 17-year reign of military terror came to an end in 1990, he and his CIA-supported goons had incarcerated, raped, tortured, or killed tens of thousands of innocent people \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 that is, people whose only \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009ccrime\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d was believing in socialism \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 with the full support of the CIA, Pentagon, Nixon, and his \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cnational security\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d team.Of course, there are also the more recent support of regime-change operations that ousted democratically elected presidents that the US government disapproved of, such as in Ukraine and Egypt.And then there is the long list of countries where unelected dictators were targeted for regime change by the US national security state and, where successful, replaced with a brutal unelected pro-US dictator. Cuba, Indonesia, Iraq, Libya, and Syria all come to mind.US officials need to keep in mind that when they point their accusatory index finger at Russia for supposedly meddling in the US presidential election, US officials have, at the same time, three fingers pointing back at themselves.

Well, the three terrorists who attacked London Bridge over the weekend found the Black and Blue Steakhouse, and they found the toughest man in the house. [Or, maybe more to the point, he found them.  Roy Larner, 47, is a huge fan of the South East London soccer team Millwall F. C. The team is known as the Lions, and when   terrorists entered the Black and Blue to kill innocent people, Larner let them know who is the true king of the jungle. After the terrorists entered, with obvious bad intentions, Larner sprang into action: \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cLike an idiot I shouted back at them. I thought, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0098I need to take the p*** out of these b*****s.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cI took a few steps towards them and said, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0098F*** you, I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099m Millwall.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 So they started attacking me. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cI stood in front of them trying to fight them off. Everyone else ran to the back. I was on my own against all three of them, that\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s why I got hurt so much. It was just me, trying to grab them with my bare hands and hold on. I was swinging. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cI got stabbed and sliced eight times. They got me in my head, chest and both hands. There was blood everywhere. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cThey were saying, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0098Islam, Islam!\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 I said again, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0098F*** you, I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099m Millwall!\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cIt was the worst thing I could have done as they carried on attacking me. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cLuckily, none of the blows were straight at me or I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d be dead. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d A petition has begun, with the aim of awarding Larner with the George Cross for bravery. The award is the second highest commendation granted by Great Britain. Looking at his scars, it\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s really hard to imagine that he won\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t get it. If Millwall is looking for a new slogan, they may have found it. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cF*** you, I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099m Millwall!\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d has a nice ring to it.

Hornberger   As US officials continue to accuse Russia of meddling with the US presidential election, an accusation that they have provided no evidence whatsoever to support, let\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s review some of the US government\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s history of meddling with elections in others countries.1. In 1951, the democratically elected parliament of Iran elected a man named Mohammad Mossadegh to be Iran\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s prime minister. Mossadegh angered British Empire officials by nationalizing British oil interests in the country.British officials then turned to the CIA for assistance. In 1953, the CIA secretly fomented a violent coup in Iran, which succeeded in ousting Mossadegh from power and making the Shah of Iran the supreme unelected dictator of the country.To fortify the Shah\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s dictatorial hold on power, the CIA helped organize and train the his domestic police force, the Savak, which was essentially a combination of the CIA, the NSA, and the military. Part of the CIA\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s training involved teaching Savak agents the art of torture.For the next 26 years, the Iranian people suffered under one of the most brutal and tyrannical dictatorships in the world, one that US officials fully supported and called an ally and friend of the United States.In 1979, Iranians successfully revolted against the Shah\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s regime and ousted him from power. One result was not a restoration of the democratic system that had elected Mossadegh but rather another brutal dictatorship, this time a religious one. Another result is the bad relations between the Iran and US governments that continues to exist today.2. In 1951, the Guatemalan people democratically elected a man named Jacobo Arbenz to be their president. Arbenz, however, was not satisfactory to US officials, especially the national-security branch of the government, specifically the Pentagon and the CIA. The reason that US officials opposed Arbenz was that he was a socialist, and US officials considered a socialist president of Guatemala to be a threat to \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cnational security\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d here in the United States.In 1954 \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 one year after the coup in Iran, the CIA fomented a violent military coup that succeeded in removing Arbenz from power and replacing him with one of the most brutal unelected military dictators in Latin American history, a man named Carlos Castillo Armas. The CIA had a kill list prepared for the coup, which Arbenz was able to escape by fleeing the country before Castillo was able to get him. The CIA\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s destruction of Guatemala\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s democratic system threw the nation into a 30-year civil war that ended up killing millions of Guatemalan people, especially many of the poor.3. In 1960 a man named Patrice Lamumba was elected Congo\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s first prime minister after independence from Belgium. Lamumba spoke out against Western imperialism and refused to take sides in the Cold War, which caused the CIA to conclude that he was a threat to \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cnational security.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d The CIA orchestrated the assassination of Lamumba, which ended up taking place on January 17, 1961, just three days before President Kennedy, who liked Lamumba and who would have ordered the CIA to stand down, was to be sworn into office.4. In 1970 a man named Salvador Allende received a plurality of votes in the presidential election in Chile. Pursuant to the Chilean constitution, the election was thrown into the national congress. President Richard Nixon, his national-security team, the Pentagon, and the CIA concluded that because Allende believed in communism and socialism, he posed a grave threat to \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cnational security\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d here in the United States. The CIA attempted to bribe members of the congress to vote against Allende. It also orchestrated the kidnapping of the head of Chile\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s armed forces, Gen Rene Schneider, who opposed a US military coup in his country, especially since a coup would violate the country\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s constitution. The kidnapping attempt on Schneider left him dead.The CIA then fomented a coup that took place on 9/11 1973 that violently ousted Allende from power and left him dead. Replacing him was army Gen. Augusto Pinochet, one of the most brutal unelected military dictators in history. By the time Pinochet\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s 17-year reign of military terror came to an end in 1990, he and his CIA-supported goons had incarcerated, raped, tortured, or killed tens of thousands of innocent people \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 that is, people whose only \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009ccrime\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d was believing in socialism \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 with the full support of the CIA, Pentagon, Nixon, and his \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cnational security\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d team.Of course, there are also the more recent support of regime-change operations that ousted democratically elected presidents that the US government disapproved of, such as in Ukraine and Egypt.And then there is the long list of countries where unelected dictators were targeted for regime change by the US national security state and, where successful, replaced with a brutal unelected pro-US dictator. Cuba, Indonesia, Iraq, Libya, and Syria all come to mind.US officials need to keep in mind that when they point their accusatory index finger at Russia for supposedly meddling in the US presidential election, US officials have, at the same time, three fingers pointing back at themselves.

Related\",\n          \"When hearing of an establishment called the Black and Blue Steakhouse, one could reasonably surmise that some, or at the very least one, extremely tough person could be found somewhere in there. Well, the three terrorists who attacked London Bridge over the weekend found the Black and Blue Steakhouse, and they found the toughest man in the house. [Or, maybe more to the point, he found them.  Roy Larner, 47, is a huge fan of the South East London soccer team Millwall F. C. The team is known as the Lions, and when   terrorists entered the Black and Blue to kill innocent people, Larner let them know who is the true king of the jungle. After the terrorists entered, with obvious bad intentions, Larner sprang into action: \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cLike an idiot I shouted back at them. I thought, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0098I need to take the p*** out of these b*****s.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cI took a few steps towards them and said, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0098F*** you, I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099m Millwall.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 So they started attacking me. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cI stood in front of them trying to fight them off. Everyone else ran to the back. I was on my own against all three of them, that\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s why I got hurt so much. It was just me, trying to grab them with my bare hands and hold on. I was swinging. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cI got stabbed and sliced eight times. They got me in my head, chest and both hands. There was blood everywhere. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cThey were saying, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0098Islam, Islam!\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 I said again, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0098F*** you, I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099m Millwall!\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cIt was the worst thing I could have done as they carried on attacking me. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cLuckily, none of the blows were straight at me or I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d be dead. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d A petition has begun, with the aim of awarding Larner with the George Cross for bravery. The award is the second highest commendation granted by Great Britain. Looking at his scars, it\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s really hard to imagine that he won\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t get it. If Millwall is looking for a new slogan, they may have found it. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cF*** you, I\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099m Millwall!\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d has a nice ring to it.
